# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) to create a fast, static website rather than a traditional web application.

## About This Site

This personal website showcases my portfolio, blog posts, and CV entries. It's built using Astro's static site generation capabilities to deliver optimal performance and SEO benefits.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

### Content Organization

- **Blog posts**: Stored in `src/content/blog/` as Markdown files
- **CV entries**: Stored in `src/content/cv/` as Markdown files  
- **Pages**: Located in `src/pages/` - each `.astro` or `.md` file becomes a route
- **Components**: Reusable UI components in `src/components/`
- **Static assets**: Images, fonts, and other static files in `public/`

The site uses Astro's Content Collections to manage blog posts and CV entries with type-safe frontmatter.
