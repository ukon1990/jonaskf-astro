### Mission

**Skolelyst** is Tine’s service that lets parents order school milk and other products for their children.  
With approximately 200 000 users, an efficient and user‑friendly solution is essential.  
I was responsible for maintaining and evolving the platform – both front‑end and back‑end – and for integrating with payment, credit‑card, and ERP partners.

### Highlights

- Built the **React** front‑end with **JavaScript** and **Redux**, adding two‑factor authentication backed by **Spring Security**.
- Developed the **Spring Boot** back‑end in **Java 8**, using **Hibernate** and **MS SQL** for persistence.
- Implemented **REST** and **SOAP** integrations with external services (NETS, Lindorff, M3).
- Managed builds and deployments via **Git**, **Gradle**, **Flyway**, and **Jenkins**.
- Centralised logging with **Splunk** and added performance monitoring through **Google Tag Manager**.
- Acted as **Scrum Master**, leading the agile team, coordinating sprints, and driving continuous improvement.

### Impact

The enhanced platform supported 200 k+ daily users with a stable, secure experience, while the integration work enabled streamlined payment processing and data exchange with Tine’s partners.
