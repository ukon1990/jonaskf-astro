summary: >
  Contributed to the development and rollout of Tradesolution’s Bridge platform — a unified digital ecosystem for 
  supply chain collaboration, transport management, and EDI integration across the Norwegian grocery and hospitality 
  sectors. Focused primarily on designing and building the React-based front-end foundation, while also contributing 
  to the Kotlin backend for the Bridge Transport module, and setting up modern CI/CD and observability in Azure.

### Mission

Bridge is a digital collaboration platform that connects and streamlines key processes across Norway’s grocery 
and hospitality sectors — from EDI document exchange to transport execution and analytics.  
Within this platform, **Bridge Transport** serves as a modern transport hub for planning, execution, and follow-up 
of deliveries, while **Bridge Flow** provides the EDI infrastructure for data exchange between industry actors.

I worked on both the shared platform foundation and the development of the **Bridge Transport module**, focusing 
on the front-end experience and component architecture, while also contributing to backend features implemented 
in Kotlin.

### Highlights

- **Front end** – Designed and implemented the component architecture, visual system, and transport workflows using 
  **React**, **SCSS**, **React Hook Form**, **TanStack Query**, and **TanStack Table**.
- **Backend contributions** – Assisted in developing and maintaining **Kotlin**/**Spring Boot** services for trips,
  route handling, transportation, booking and analytics.
- **CI/CD** – Automated builds, linting, testing, and container deployments to **Azure Kubernetes Service** through 
  **Azure Pipelines**.
- **Testing** – Delivered unit and integration coverage using **Jest**, **JUnit**, **MockK**, 
  **Mongock**, and **TestContainers**.
- **Observability** – Implemented logging to **Datadog** and **LogRocket**. Allowing for real-time insight into the 
  system and tracing events from the frontend to the backend.

### Impact

Bridge replaces manual and fragmented processes with a shared, digital infrastructure for the grocery value chain.  
- **Bridge Flow** reduces administrative workload and costs by standardising EDI communication across the industry.  
- **Bridge Transport** automates planning and follow-up of deliveries, offering real-time tracking, deviation handling, 
  and performance insights.  

The foundations I helped build continue to support ongoing feature development and the expansion of the Bridge 
ecosystem.
