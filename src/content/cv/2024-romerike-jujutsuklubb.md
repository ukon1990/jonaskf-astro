### Motivation

Romerike Jujutsuklubb is the club where I trained as a teenager, and later rejoined with my wife and kids.  
The website has primarily been maintained by Uwe, but I — together with a few others — contribute to the development and upkeep.  
As part of the web committee, I continue to support the project whenever time allows, helping the club provide useful digital tools for its members.

- **Deployment:** Git-based workflow (Heroku/club-managed server)
- **Collaboration:** Contributions managed via Git, working alongside the club’s main maintainer
