### Mission

Holocaustsenteret maintained the sites **hlsenteret.no** and **folkemord.no** on WordPress, with map integration from Geodata, initially developed by Crayon Consulting AS’s UX team.  
The solution was hosted on **AWS**, later moved to an on‑premise environment.

### Highlights

- Assisted with **debugging** and **troubleshooting** hosting problems on the AWS deployment.
- Worked on **PHP** and **WordPress** codebases, addressing server‑side issues in **Apache**.
- Updated and refined **JavaScript** and **jQuery** components to improve stability.

### Impact

My support ensured that the WordPress sites remained operational during the AWS hosting period, maintaining continuous access for users and stakeholders.
