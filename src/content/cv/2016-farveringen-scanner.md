### Mission

I developed a new digital platform for **Farveringen / Malproff** during this project.  
My core task was to build an **Android native app** that enables store employees to order goods from a central warehouse. The app lets users search for products by scanning a barcode or by manually entering a GTIN/NOBB number.

### Highlights

- Designed and implemented the Android prototype using **Java** and **SQLite** for local persistence.
- Integrated barcode‑scanning functionality and a manual search field for GTIN/NOBB input.
- Created the UI with mock‑ups from **Adobe Experience Design**, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Delivered a fully functional app that reduced the time required for employees to place orders.
