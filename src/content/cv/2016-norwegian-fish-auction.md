### Mission

I joined a team of 3‑4 developers to create a **disruptive B2B auction solution** for the frozen‑fish market.  
The goal was to host large‑scale auctions that ran at the start of each day, leveraging AWS auto‑scaling to keep costs low while handling many buyers and sellers simultaneously.

### Highlights

- Implemented the **front‑end web client** with **Angular 2** and **TypeScript**, and a mobile‑friendly interface.
- Built the **back‑end** using **Spring Boot** and **Java 8**, exposing a **REST API** for client communication.
- Added automated tests with **JUnit** and **Mockito** to ensure code quality.
- Employed **Scrum** methodology, with tasks tracked in **JIRA** and documentation in **Confluence**.
- Managed source control with **Git/Bitbucket** and automated CI/CD pipelines using **Bamboo** on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
- Used **MySQL** for persistent storage and integrated seamlessly with AWS services for a stateless architecture.

### Impact

The solution enabled Norwegian Fish Auction to host auctions that automatically scaled with demand, drastically reducing server overhead while maintaining a responsive user experience for both buyers and sellers. The modular, REST‑based architecture also positioned the platform for easy future expansion and feature addition.
