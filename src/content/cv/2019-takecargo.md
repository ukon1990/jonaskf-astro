### Mission

TakeCargo connects transport buyers, suppliers, and carriers through a shared digital workflow.  
Our goal was to eliminate paper-based processes, standardise data exchange (GS1/STAND), and improve traceability 
across the transport chain.

### Highlights

- Worked as a **full-stack developer** in a small, cross-functional team running three-week sprints.  
- Rebuilt the **React** front end, migrated key modules to **TypeScript**, implemented **Redux** patterns, and improved 
  test coverage with **Jest**.  
- Extended and maintained **Dropwizard** and **Spring Boot** backend services deployed to **Azure Kubernetes Service**.  
- Delivered an automated **reporting pipeline** using **Azure Logic Apps** and scheduled functions, integrating 
  drilldown dashboards directly into the platform.  
- Contributed to a **project with ASKO Maritime**, implementing functionality for **booking drone-based transport** 
  and developing a dedicated **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for drivers — enabling them to register pickups and deliveries, 
  view parking spots, and open harbour gates directly from mobile devices.  
- Managed CI/CD with **Azure Pipelines**, containerised services, and coordinated deployments to shared environments.

### Impact

The modernised platform automated manual workflows, improved data quality for transport planning, 
and removed paper-based handoffs.  
The ASKO Maritime integration demonstrated the platform’s flexibility by supporting new logistics technologies 
like drone transport.  
Enhanced testing and deployment automation reduced lead time and improved reliability for each release.
